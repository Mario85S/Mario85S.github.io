# Data Analyst and Data Science Enthusiast üìäüîç

Hello! I'm an aspiring data analyst with a passion for turning raw data into actionable insights.
I hold the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** and recently completed a rigorous **6-month Data Science Bootcamp**,
where I honed my skills in various tools and techniques. Let's dive into what I can offer:

## Skills and Proficiencies
- __Spreadsheets__: I'm adept at using spreadsheets (such as Excel or Google Sheets) for data manipulation, calculations, and visualization.
- **SQL**: I can write SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from relational databases.
- **R**: I've explored R for statistical analysis, data visualization, and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Python**: Python is my go-to language for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning.
- **Tableau**: I've created interactive visualizations and dashboards in Tableau to communicate complex insights effectively.
